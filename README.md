The basic tools and model files related to paper "Beyond still images: Temporal features and input variance resilience"

For better practical use, can edit the streams with more up to date versions of themselves. This study was used to show inclusion of temporal features in training can increase models resiliance to input variance change. The augmentations generator can be fund in preprocess sections. Various kind of random augmentations were tested and different setups can be easily created based on the code.

The training samples are just some of the few setups in which models can be trained and evaluated in. The model is flexible in inclusion or exclusion of the streams and many different other setups can be used for training and evaluation using this structure.
